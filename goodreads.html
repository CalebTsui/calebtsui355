                <!-- <img src="images/VA/va-bg.png" alt=""> -->
                <p>I began the research by conducting a <span class="highlight">heuristic walkthrough</span> of the app,
                    documenting usability issues and observations. These findings then informed the planning of user
                    interviews, which were used to <span class="highlight">validate and expand on the identified
                        insights</span>.</p>

                <p>Within two days, I recruited and interviewed <span class="highlight">4 participants</span> across two
                    rounds: an initial exploratory interview followed by a more targeted session focused on specific
                    features (Community, Bookshelves, & Discovery). Participants were guided through <span
                        class="highlight">structured questions</span> and <span class="highlight">task-based
                        activities</span> while their interactions with the mobile app were observed.</p>

                    navigation to support intuitive decision-making, <span class="highlight">reducing the need for users

                <h2>The prototype was evaluated with three participants, and the insights gathered were used to refine
                    key features. </h2>
                <p>The test focused on assessing the usability of the proposed community features and how effectively
                    users could complete primary tasks, including <span class="highlight">finding a new group to join
                        and creating a new group</span>. The Participants were asked to complete realistic scenarios
                    using the Think Aloud method to surface any usability issues.</p>

                <h1>Time Manage and recognize scope</h1>
                <p>From this experience, I learned the importance of adaptability and proactive decision-making. By the
                    second week, I realized that I was falling behind and that my process was not working. Instead of
                    prolonging the issue, I decided to restart the project and adjust my approach to stay on track and
                    ensure a strong process. This lesson reinforced the importance of reflecting on my process,
                    recognizing what isn’t working, and taking timely action to improve outcomes in design projects.</p>

                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>With additional time, I would broaden the scope of this project. Constraints required staying within
                    the existing Goodreads branding and focusing primarily on the Community feature. In a larger-scale
                    redesign, I would revamp the app’s overall UI to address clarity issues identified in interviews and
                    conduct more in-depth research to explore user engagement with the Community feature.s</p>
