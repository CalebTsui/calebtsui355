                <p>I began the research by conducting a <span class="highlight">heuristic walkthrough</span> of the app, documenting usability issues and observations. These findings then informed the planning of user interviews, which were used to <span class="highlight">validate and expand on the identified insights</span>.</p>

                <p>Within two days, I recruited and interviewed <span class="highlight">4 participants</span> across two rounds: an initial exploratory interview followed by a more targeted session focused on specific features (Community, Bookshelves, & Discovery). Participants were guided through <span class="highlight">structured questions</span> and <span class="highlight">task-based activities</span> while their interactions with the mobile app were observed.</p>

                <h1>Recognize what’s working and what’s not.</h1>
                <p>Overall, this semester-long project has provided me with <b>valuable experience in conducting research and creating solutions for a real-world organization</b>. My course instructor applauded that the activity booklet we've developed holds significant potential for implementation in other aquarium and cultural institutions due to its flexibility and broad demographic use.</p>

                <p>Through this project, I developed the ability to <b>critically assess when an idea is effective and when it is not</b>. I learned how to quickly identify stagnating concepts, let them go, and strategically re-pivot the project toward more impactful and viable solutions. While it can be painful to let go of ideas that feel exciting or “cool,” it is important to prioritize user needs and business objectives.</p>

                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>Due to the course structure and the organization’s policy, there was limited time to conduct user testing on the final prototype, and interaction with youth under the age of 16 was not permitted. If I had more time, I would conduct <b>conduct usability testings on the final prototype and iterate based on the findings</b>. This is important as conducting usability tests would be the logical next phase to ensure that users are engaging with it as intended.</p>
