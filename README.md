IAT 355 â€“ Assignment 2: Personal Website

Purpose:
This website serves as a platform to showcase the visualizations created throughout the course. As the semester progresses, more project boxes will appear on the homepage.

Technologies Used:
The website is primarily built with HTML and CSS, with JavaScript used to add interactivity to the visualizations. The site is hosted on GitHub.

Instructions:
The navigation is straightforward - the homepage links to all completed and upcoming projects for this class. The header contains a navigation bar with links to the Home page (aka my name), About page (includes a detailed description about me) and the first visualization (Assignment 2). Over time, this section will be updated to display only the most current versions of each visualization/assignment.
