                <p>Building on the theme of active exploration, the cut-out activities shaped like a shark and a
                    submarine allow visitors to <span class="highlight">view the aquarium through playful
                        openings</span>. This creates a <span class="highlight">more immersive experience</span> by
                    encouraging them to see the exhibits from a unique perspective.</p>

                <h2>The Creative Activities</h2>
                <p>The open-ended prompts, such as finish the drawing, decorate the fish tank, and draw the habitat.
                    These activities provide visitors the opportunity to <span class="highlight">document their findings

                <h1>Recognize what’s working and what’s not.</h1>
                <p>Overall, this semester-long project has provided me with <b>valuable experience in conducting
                        research and creating solutions for a real-world organization</b>. My course instructor
                    applauded that the activity booklet we've developed holds significant potential for implementation
                    in other aquarium and cultural institutions due to its flexibility and broad demographic use.</p>

                <p>Through this project, I developed the ability to <b>critically assess when an idea is effective and
                        when it is not</b>. I learned how to quickly identify stagnating concepts, let them go, and
                    strategically re-pivot the project toward more impactful and viable solutions. While it can be
                    painful to let go of ideas that feel exciting or “cool,” it is important to prioritize user needs
                    and business objectives.</p>

                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>Due to the course structure and the organization’s policy, there was limited time to conduct user
                    testing on the final prototype, and interaction with youth under the age of 16 was not permitted. If
                    I had more time, I would conduct <b>conduct usability testings on the final prototype and iterate
                        based on the findings</b>. This is important as conducting usability tests would be the logical
                    next phase to ensure that users are engaging with it as intended.</p>
