                <p>I developed a branding guideline outlining typography (spacing, leading, weight), image treatments, vector usage, and the color palette. The Branding Toolkit was adopted across CaseIT to ensure all members followed the guidelines when creating assets. Below are snapshots from the toolkit.</p>
